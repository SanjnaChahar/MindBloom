# MindBloom 🌱

MindBloom is a fun and gentle mental health web app focused on mood awareness and self-reflection.

#Why this project?
I have personally explored various mental health applications and observed how their fun and interactive
designs make mental well-being more approachable, especially for teenagers and young adults.

Finding this concept fascinating, I decided to build a mental health website that focuses on creating a
positive, engaging, and non-judgmental space for users to understand and track their emotions.

- Anonymous thought jar
- Emotion vocabulary builder
